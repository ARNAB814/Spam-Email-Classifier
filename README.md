# Spam-Email-Detector
 
## Overview
This Email Spam Detection project utilizes AI and ML technologies to identify and filter out spam emails. The project is based on Python and leverages libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-Learn. The core of the project is a Logistic Regression model trained on a dataset of emails categorized as 'spam' or 'ham'.

## Features
- **Spam Detection:** Classifies emails into 'spam' or 'ham'.
- **Data Processing:** Implements effective data cleaning and preprocessing techniques.
- **Machine Learning Model:** Uses Logistic Regression for classification.
- **Feature Extraction:** Employs TF-IDF Vectorization to convert text data into feature vectors.
